"""Validate the interactive controls of every built sample report in a bundle.

Rationale
---------
A dashboard control that is wired to the wrong column does not fail loudly.
It returns a plausible-looking table, and in the case that prompted this
script it returned an empty one, which reads as a genuine absence of events
rather than as a defect. Nothing downstream catches that: the build succeeds,
the zip is produced, the report is signed out.

The specific defect was an index computed against one representation of the
table and applied to another. The supporting-read threshold resolved its
column by scanning thead after DataTables had detached the hidden columns'
<th> elements, so the index enumerated visible columns while the row data
stayed indexed over all of them. Four hidden columns preceded the target, the
threshold was applied to a free-text column four positions earlier, and every
row scored zero.

The parser now supplies the index, so the two representations cannot diverge.
This script asserts that they have not: it reads the index the report will
use and confirms that the header at that position is the supporting-read
column and that the column holds numbers.

Checks per sample report
------------------------
  1. the threshold control markup is present
  2. the emitted supportCol is an integer, or -1 with the disabled path taken
  3. the <th> at that index is the supporting-read header
  4. the <td> cells at that index carry numeric data-order values
  5. the predicate keeps rows it cannot parse rather than dropping them
  6. the index is assigned once, from a literal, and never recomputed

A seventh check, that the SV-type filter admits graded rows, is deliberately
absent. It asserts that the tab's predicate consults data-tier before
excluding on data-translocation, which presupposes that the annotator grades
its calls. This pipeline's annotator emits known_mm_pair and known_freq only,
so every row would carry an empty tier and the check would fail every report.
It belongs with the annotator upgrade, not here.

Reports with no translocation table are skipped, which is a legitimate
outcome and not a failure.

Accepts a build directory, a distributed .zip bundle, or a single report
file, so the artefact that actually reaches a reader can be validated without
being unpacked first.

Exit status
-----------
  0  every report checked passed, or none contained a translocation table
  1  at least one report failed a check
  2  the path is unusable or holds no sample reports
