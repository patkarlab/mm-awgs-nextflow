# make_report_zip.sh
#
# Package a built report bundle into a zip for release to reporting staff.
#
# The archive is written to the directory the command was run from. Pass --out
# to put it somewhere else.
#
# Usage:
#   tools/make_report_zip.sh <bundle_dir> [--light] [--force] [--out <dir>]
#
# Examples:
#   tools/make_report_zip.sh report_v7_20260713_24h --light
#   tools/make_report_zip.sh report_v7_20260713_24h --out /goast/reports
#
# --light omits the igv/ directories. The IGV pages embed alignment slices and
# dominate the archive size; without them every tab still renders and only the
# paired breakpoint viewer is unavailable. Use --light for anything that has to
# be moved off the server, and the full archive for local archival.
#
# The zip is built with the bundle directory as its top-level entry, so it
# unpacks into a single folder rather than scattering files.
